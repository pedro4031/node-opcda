## Description

**`node-opcda`** is a Node.js client library designed to connect to OPC DA (Data Access) servers and easily read, write, and monitor industrial data. It's perfect for automation, IoT, and SCADA applications that need to interact with OPC DA systems.

## Features

* Connect to OPC DA servers.
* Read tag values.
* Write values to tags.
* Subscribe to data changes.
* Handle errors gracefully.

## Installation

You can install the library using `npm`:

```bash
npm install @pedro4031/node-opcda
```

## Future Plans

We are continuously working on improving `node-opcda`. Here are some features and improvements we plan to add in the near future:

* **Suport for simple read operations:** We are actively working to implement basic synchronous and asynchronous data reading.
* **Suport for simple write operations:** We will add functionality for writing values back to the OPC server.
* * **Suport for async operations:** We will add support for async operations.
* **Performance Optimizations:** We are exploring ways to enhance data reading and writing performance.
* **Extended Data Types:** We plan to support a wider range of OPC data types.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:** We will continue to expand our documentation with more detailed examples and use cases.

Your feedback and contributions are highly valuable in helping us prioritize these features.
